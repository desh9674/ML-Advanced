Therefore, instead of finding the values of y1 and y2 sequentially (using for loop) we can compute them in parallel using dot product.\n","\n","#Element-Wise Product\n","There are few situations where you need to compute element-wise multiplication of two matrices of same dimensions.\n","\n","The resulting dimension will be same as the dimensions of two matrices used for element-wise multiplication.\n","\n","We use multiply() function of numpy package in python to compute element-wise product of two matrices.\n","\n","#Dot product Example\n","Sample code in Python for a dot product\n","\n","```\n","import numpy as np \n","\n","\n","\n","#matrix a\n","\n","a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\n","\n","print(\"matrix a dimension \", a.shape)\n","\n","\n","\n","#matrix b\n","\n","b = np.array([[5,6,7],[8,9, 10]]) \n","\n","print(\"matrix b dimension \", b.shape)\n","\n","\n","\n","#matrix c = a.b\n","\n","c = np.dot(a,b)\n","\n","print(\"dot product of a and b: \", c)\n","\n","print(\"matrix c dimension \", c.shape)\n","\n","\n","output:\n","\n","matrix a dimension  (2, 2)\n","\n","matrix b dimension  (2, 3)\n","\n","dot product of a and b:  [[21 24 27]\n","\n"," [47 54 61]]\n","\n","matrix c dimension  (2, 3)\n","```\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FjUKIdDyI0aI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}

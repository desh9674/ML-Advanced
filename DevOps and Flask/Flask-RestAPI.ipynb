returned by any of the methods defined in a Resource class is a Python Data Structure, then it is rendered as it is.\n","\n","However, if an other object is returned, the rendering may not be as expected.\n","\n","As a reason, Flask-RESTful provides fields module to specify the structure of response.\n","\n","Structure of a response must be either a dictionary of an Ordered dictionary.\n","\n","\n","#Different Field Types\n","Some of the available field types are:\n","\n","Field Name\tDescription\n","\n","fields.Raw\tBase field class, from which custom fields can be derived\n","\n","fields.String\tOutputs a value as String\n","\n","fields.Float\tOutputs a value as Float\n","\n","fields.Integer\tOutputs a value as Integer\n","\n","fields.Boolean\tOutputs a value as a Boolean\n","\n","fields.Url\tOutputs an URL in a string form\n","\n","fields.DateTime\tReturns a formated datetime string in UTC\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","#Using 'marshal' methods\n","Flask-RESTful also comes with methods like `marsha`l, `marshal_with` and `marshal_with_field`, which are useful for filtering the response data from return values of methods.\n","\n","`marshal` method of Flask-RESTful package provides the ability to filter data of specified fields in a desired format.\n","\n","`marshal` method takes either a dictionary, list, or an object as input of data and a dictionary of fields, to be available in output, and filters the data based on those fields.\n","\n","An example of using `marshal` in flask shell is shown below. It filters only the `name` field from data dictionary.\n","```\n",">>> from flask_restful import marshal\n",">>> data = {'age':36, 'name':'Philiphs'}\n",">>> from flask_restful import fields\n",">>> required_fields = {'name':fields.Raw}\n",">>> marshal(data, required_fields)\n","OrderedDict([('name', 'Philiphs')])\n","\n","````\n","\n","#Using 'marshal_with'\n","In addition to marshal method, you can also use marshal_with decorator for marshalling the return object of a method with specified data fields.\n","\n","The below example decorates get method with marshal_with.\n","```\n",">>> from flask_restful import fields, marshal_with\n",">>> required_fields = { 'name': fields.Raw }\n",">>> @marshal_with(required_fields)\n","... def get():\n","...     return { 'age': 36, 'name': 'Philips' }\n","...\n",">>> get()\n","OrderedDict([('name', 'Philips')])\n","```\n","\n","\n","#Using 'marshal_with_field'\n","marshal_with_field is an another decorator which formats return values of methods with a single field.\n","\n","In below example, marshal_with_field converts all values into integers.\n","```\n",">>> from flask_restful import marshal_with_field, fields\n",">>> @marshal_with_field(fields.Integer)\n","... def get():\n","...     return '2', 3.0, 5\n","...\n",">>> get()\n","(2, 3, 5)\n","```\n","\n","#Formatting Output Example\n","Now let's understand, how to format response using fields and marshal_with by modifying simpleinterest.py file as specified below.\n","\n","It defines a dictionary of expected output fields resource_fields and the post method is decorated using marshal_with.\n","\n","```\n","Edited simpleinterest.py\n",".....\n","import datetime as dt\n","from flask_restful import fields, marshal_with\n","\n",".....\n","resource_fields = {\n","    'simple_interest': fields.Raw,\n","    'computed_on': fields.DateTime(dt_format='rfc822')\n","}\n","class SimpleInterest(Resource):\n","\n","    @marshal_with(resource_fields)\n","    def post(self):\n","        args = parser.parse_args()\n","        .....\n","        return {'simple_interest':si, 'computed_on':dt.datetime.now()}\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","#Viewing POST response\n","The format of fields `simple_interest` and `computed_on` are defined as a `raw string` and `rfc822` formatted date string types.\n","\n","Now try sending POST request to SimpleInterest resource using below command.\n","`\n","$ python accessing_si_app.py\n","`\n","The expected response from `request1` appears similar to one shown below.\n","Expected Response\n","\n","```\n","b'{\"computed_on\": \"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:39:48 -0000\", \"simple_interest\": 6000.0}\\n'\n","```\n","\n","\n","#Renaming Attributes\n","Any field name, displayed to users, can be altered from it's internal field name by renaming it.\n","\n","Renaming an internal field name can be achieved by setting `attribute` parameter value, of any field type, to the new public field name.\n","\n","An example of using attribute is shown below. It renames field name, `private_name` to `public_name.`\n","```\n","fields = {\n","    'public_name': fields.String(attribute='private_name'),\n","    'address': fields.String,\n","    'age':fields.Integer,\n","}\n","```\n","\n","\n","#Custom Fields\n","fields module can also be used to create custom fields.\n","A custom field has to be derived from fields.Raw class and must contain definition of format method.\n","In below example, LowerCase class is derived from fields.Raw class and it's format method transforms an input value into lower case.\n","```\n","class
